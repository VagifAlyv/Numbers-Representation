In numerical analysis, spline interpolation is a method of constructing a smooth curve that passes through a set of given points. This technique is widely used in computer graphics, engineering, and various other fields. In this project, we utilize spline interpolation to draw numbers.

Numbers Representation:

Number 0
Cubic spline interpolation is used to draw the number 0.

Number 1
Cubic spline interpolation is used to draw the number 1.

Number 2
Cubic spline interpolation is used to draw the number 2.

Number 3
Cubic and linear spline interpolations are combined to draw the number 3.

Implementation
The code is written in Python using the NumPy library for numerical computations and the Matplotlib library for visualization.
